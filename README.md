# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

### ðŸ“Œ About the Project  
The **Requirement Analysis Project** focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.  

Through well-defined tasks, I aim to create a detailed blueprint for the **requirement analysis phase of a booking management system**â€”simulating real-world development scenarios.  

### ðŸš€ Key Highlights  
âœ… Understanding functional & non-functional requirements.  
âœ… Leveraging tools like **Draw.io** for visualizing system requirements.  
âœ… Establishing **clear acceptance criteria** for project alignment.  
âœ… Applying **best practices** to produce industry-standard documentation.  

ðŸ”¹ This repository serves as the central hub for my **requirement analysis phase** and documentation efforts.
