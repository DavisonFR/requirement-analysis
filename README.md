- Identifying challenges, constraints, and critical system behaviors.  
- Engaging with domain experts and users to refine expectations.  

### 📌 **3. Requirement Documentation**  
- Structuring requirements into a **clear, organized format** using **text, tables, and diagrams**.  
- Creating **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** documents.  
- Ensuring requirements are detailed, well-written, and understandable by all stakeholders.  

### 📌 **4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
- Categorizing requirements into **functional** (system actions) & **non-functional** (performance, security, reliability).  
- Creating **use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and process models** to visualize system operations.  
- Reviewing dependencies between different requirements for completeness and consistency.  

### 📌 **5. Requirement Validation**  
- Checking if requirements are **complete, feasible, testable, and aligned** with business goals.  
- Conducting peer reviews, stakeholder meetings, and prototype evaluations to confirm accuracy.  
- Refining requirements based on feedback before finalizing the documentation.  

Each of these activities is essential for ensuring that the software meets user needs, operates efficiently, and aligns with overall project objectives! 🚀  
## Types of Requirements  

Requirement Analysis includes two primary categories: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential for building a scalable, user-friendly, and efficient **hotel booking management system**.  

### **📌 Functional Requirements**  
Functional requirements define the **specific actions** that the system must perform to meet business and user needs.  

🔹 **Examples for the Booking Management System:**  
✅ **Hotel Listing & Management** – Hotel managers can add, update, and remove hotel details.  
✅ **Search & Filtering** – Customers can search hotels based on location, price, ratings, and availability.  
✅ **Booking Process** – Users can select a hotel, choose check-in/check-out dates, and confirm reservations.  
✅ **Payment Integration** – Secure transaction processing via third-party payment services.  
✅ **User Authentication & Profiles** – Customers and hotel managers must log in to access features.  
✅ **Booking Cancellation & Refunds** – Customers can cancel bookings within a specified timeframe with refunds processed accordingly.  
✅ **Notifications & Alerts** – Automated messages sent for booking confirmations, cancellations, and updates.

### **📌 Non-functional Requirements**  
Non-functional requirements define the **performance, security, and reliability** aspects of the system rather than its direct functions.  

🔹 **Examples for the Booking Management System:**  
✅ **Scalability** – The system can handle **high traffic volumes** using microservices and load balancers.  
✅ **Performance Optimization** – The use of **Redis caching** reduces database load and accelerates responses.
